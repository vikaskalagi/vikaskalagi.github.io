I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at UCSB (2024–2026), with a focus on research in distributed systems. I am a proud member of the Distributed Systems Lab, where I work under the guidance of Professors Divyakant Agrawal and Amr El Abbadi.

Before joining UCSB, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at PES University, India. After graduation, I worked as a Software Engineer at MakeMyTrip, and later as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India for two years, contributing to cutting-edge research in the field.

I am deeply passionate about advancing the field of computer science through both applied and theoretical research, and I’m excited to continue exploring innovative solutions to complex problems in distributed systems.
